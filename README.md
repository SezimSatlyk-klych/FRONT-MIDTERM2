Movie App
This Movies App lets users easily find and explore movies. You can search for any movie using the search bar, and it shows suggestions as you type. There are buttons to sort movies by popularity, release date, or rating, so you can browse in the order you prefer. Each movie appears in a grid format with its poster, title, and a "Details" button. When clicked, a popup shows more details like the overview, genres, release date, runtime, cast, and rating.

You can also add movies to your watchlist, which is saved in local storage so it stays there even if you leave the page. The app sends a quick toast notification when you add or remove a movie from the watchlist. Itâ€™s designed to work smoothly on any device, and it uses the TMDb API for real-time movie data.
